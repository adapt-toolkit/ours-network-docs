_Understanding how Private Circles work in Our Intentions_

## What are Private Circles?

Private Circles are your personal audience management tool. Think of them as filters that help you organize your audience into groups. Only you, as the author, can see the internal structure of your Private Circles - your audience members don't see which circles they belong to.

## Key Features

### Audience Organization
- Create multiple Private Circles to segment your audience (e.g., "Close Friends", "Family", "Work Colleagues")
- Move followers between circles freely without their knowledge
- Target specific groups when sharing intentions

### Privacy for You
- Only you can see the circle structure
- Followers simply see themselves as part of your audience
- Your organizational system remains private

### One-Way Communication
- You share intentions with specific circles
- Audience members receive your posts and can react to them
- They cannot see other members or the circle they're in
