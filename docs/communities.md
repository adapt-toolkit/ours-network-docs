_Understanding how Communities work in Our Intentions_

---

## What are Communities?

Communities are public groups where members can collaborate and share intentions together. Unlike Private Circles, Communities are visible to all members, and everyone knows they're part of the community. Members can suggest posts that, once approved by the community manager, are shared with all members.

## Key Features

### Explicit Membership
- People must be explicitly invited to join a community
- You cannot simply move someone from your audience to a community
- Members must give explicit confirmation to join
- Everyone can see who else is in the community

### Collaborative Content
- Any member can suggest a post (intention) to the community
- Suggested posts appear as "Post Requests" for the manager
- The manager reviews and decides to accept or decline each request
- Accepted posts are distributed to all community members

### Community Management
- As a community creator, you become the manager
- You moderate content by reviewing post requests
- You can invite new members and manage existing ones

## How Communities Work

### For Managers:
1. **Create a Community**: Tap "Create" and choose "Community"
2. **Invite Members**: Share invite links - recipients must accept
3. **Review Post Requests**: Check incoming post suggestions
4. **Accept or Decline**: Approved posts go to all members

### For Members:
1. **Accept Invitation**: Join by accepting a community invite
2. **View Content**: See posts shared within the community
3. **Suggest Posts**: Submit your own intentions for review
4. **React and Engage**: Support other members' intentions

---

## Post Request Flow

1. A member creates a post and submits it to the community
2. The post appears in the manager's "Requests" tab
3. The manager reviews the content
4. If **accepted**: The post is published to all community members
5. If **declined**: The post is not shared (author is notified)

## Private Circles vs Communities

| Feature | Private Circles | Communities |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Visibility | Only author sees structure | All members see each other |
| Joining | Automatic when following | Requires explicit acceptance |
| Content Creation | Author only | Any member (with approval) |
| Moving Members | Can move freely | Must invite explicitly |
| Purpose | Audience management | Collaborative sharing |

## Best Practices

- Use Communities for groups where collaboration is desired
- Set clear guidelines for what content is appropriate
- Review post requests regularly to keep content flowing
- Use Private Circles when you want control over who sees what
