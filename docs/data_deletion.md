# Data Deletion

_Last updated: August 27, 2025_

In order to delete your account go to Profile tab, then press 3 dots on the top right part of the screen, then choose "Edit Profile", then choose "Delete Account" button.

This deletes all the [data that we store and collect](privacy.md).

To use the app again, reinstall the application after account is deleted.
